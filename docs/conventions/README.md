# Conventions and Standards

This folder contains coding standards, naming conventions, and best practices for the home lab project.

## Contents

### Planned Documents

- **naming-conventions.md** - Naming standards for hosts, services, files, variables
- **coding-standards.md** - Language-specific coding standards
- **documentation-standards.md** - How to write and maintain documentation
- **git-workflow.md** - Git branching, commits, and PR guidelines
- **security-practices.md** - Security best practices and requirements
- **configuration-management.md** - How to manage configuration files

## Status

**Current Phase:** Planning - Conventions to be established based on technology choices

## General Principles

### Keep It Simple
- Avoid over-engineering
- Make focused changes
- Delete unused code completely
- No premature abstractions

### Be Consistent
- Follow established patterns
- Use consistent naming
- Maintain uniform style

### Document Decisions
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Update docs when making changes
- Use comments only where logic isn't self-evident

### Security First
- Never commit secrets
- Validate input at boundaries
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated

## Naming Conventions (Draft)

### Hostnames
*To be defined based on infrastructure design*

### Service Names
*To be defined*

### File Naming
*To be defined*

### Variable Naming
*To be defined based on languages chosen*

## Code Review Guidelines

*To be established once development begins*

## Guidelines for Convention Docs

1. Make conventions clear and unambiguous
2. Provide examples (good and bad)
3. Explain rationale behind conventions
4. Keep conventions practical and enforceable
5. Update when project needs evolve
