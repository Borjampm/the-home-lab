## Guidelines for Infrastructure Docs

1. Keep hardware inventories up to date
2. Document IP addressing schemes and VLANs
3. Include configuration file locations
4. Document dependencies between services
5. Maintain runbooks for common operations
6. Include recovery procedures

## Runbook Template

Each runbook should include:
- **Purpose** - What this procedure accomplishes
- **Prerequisites** - What's needed before starting
- **Steps** - Detailed step-by-step instructions
- **Verification** - How to confirm success
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
- **Rollback** - How to undo changes if needed
