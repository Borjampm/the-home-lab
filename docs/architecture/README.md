# Architecture Documentation

This folder contains system design, architecture decisions, and component diagrams for the home lab infrastructure.

## Contents

### Planned Documents

- **system-design.md** - Overall system architecture and design principles
- **network-topology.md** - Network layout, IP addressing, VLANs, routing
- **component-diagram.md** - Hardware and software components overview
- **data-flow.md** - How data flows through the system
- **security-architecture.md** - Security zones, authentication, access control
- **adr/** - Architecture Decision Records (ADR) subfolder

## Status

**Current Phase:** Planning - Architecture documents to be created based on requirements

## Guidelines for Creating Architecture Docs

1. Use diagrams where helpful (Mermaid, PlantUML, or ASCII art)
2. Document the "why" behind architectural decisions
3. Keep documents focused and modular
4. Cross-reference related documents
5. Update when architecture evolves

## Template Structure

Each architecture document should include:
- **Overview** - High-level summary
- **Requirements** - What this addresses
- **Design** - The architectural approach
- **Components** - Key elements and their interactions
- **Trade-offs** - Pros, cons, and alternatives considered
- **References** - Related docs and external resources
