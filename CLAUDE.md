# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal home lab project for connecting and managing computers and other utilities. The project is in early development. This place will be used for three main purposes:
1. Research technologies and tools that can be used to build a home lab.
2. Test and validate technologies and ideas.
3. Build a home lab in a peer to peer network.

## Technologies

To use python, uv will be used.

## Documentation

The entry point to the documentation is the README.md file, which serves as an index to the rest of the projects documents. The rest of the documents live in the docs folder. Before any development or answer, search if the documentation has relevant information. Inside each fodler will be a README.md file that is an index to that folder.

## Architecture

*To be documented as the project evolves.*

## Commands

*To be documented as tooling is added.*
